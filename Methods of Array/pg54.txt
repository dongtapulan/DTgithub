
```java
for (int j = 0; j < arrivalTimeEmp.length; j++)
    arrivalTimeEmp[j] = new Clock();
```

### Explanation
1. **for Loop Initialization**: The `for` loop is set up to iterate through the entire length of the array `arrivalTimeEmp`.
2. **Array Element Assignment**: Inside the loop, each element of the `arrivalTimeEmp` array is assigned a new instance of the `Clock` class.
3. **Clock Class**: The `Clock` class has three fields: `hr`, `min`, and `sec`, all initialized to 0.

### Visual Representation
The diagram shows the array `arrivalTimeEmp` with several elements, each element being an instance of the `Clock` class. For example:
- `arrivalTimeEmp[0]` points to a `Clock` object with `hr`, `min`, and `sec` fields set to 0.
- Similarly, `arrivalTimeEmp[49]` and `arrivalTimeEmp[99]` point to their respective `Clock` objects, each initialized to 0.

### Key Takeaway
This section demonstrates how to create and initialize an array of objects in Java. 
By looping through the array and instantiating each element, you ensure that every 
slot in the array is filled with a properly initialized object, preventing `null` references.
