Explanation of Searching an Array for a Specific Item
This process is an example of Linear Search, which involves checking each element of the array one by one until the target value is found.

Understanding the Process:
We have an array list:


list = [35, 12, 27, 18, 45, 16, 38]
(Indexes: [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6])

Goal: Find if 27 exists in the array.

Steps:

Compare 27 with list[0] = 35 (No match).
Compare 27 with list[1] = 12 (No match).
Compare 27 with list[2] = 27 (Match found).
The search stops because we found 27.
