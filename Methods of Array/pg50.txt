### **Explanation of the Java Code: Sequential Search Algorithm**
The code implements a **sequential search** algorithm to find a specific item in an array.

#### **Code Breakdown:**
```java
public static int seqSearch(int[] list, int searchItem) {
```
- This defines a **static method** named `seqSearch` that takes:
  - `list` â†’ an array of integers (`int[]`)
  - `searchItem` â†’ an integer that we are searching for
- The method returns an `int`, which is either the **index of the item if found** or **-1 if not found**.

---

```java
int location = 0; // Start from the first element
boolean found = false; // Track if the item is found
```
- `location = 0` â†’ This variable keeps track of the current position in the array.
- `found = false` â†’ A boolean flag that becomes `true` if `searchItem` is found.

---

```java
while (location < list.length && !found) {
```
- **Loop through the array** as long as:
  - `location` is **within array bounds** (`location < list.length`).
  - `found` is **false** (stops early if the item is found).

---

```java
if (list[location] == searchItem) {
    found = true; // Item is found
} else {
    location++; // Move to the next index
}
```
- **Condition check:** If the element at `list[location]` is equal to `searchItem`:
  - `found = true;` â†’ Marks that the item is found.
- **Otherwise**, move to the next index (`location++`).

---

```java
// If found, return the index; if not, return -1
return found ? location : -1;
```
- **Ternary operator (`? :`)**:
  - If `found == true`, return `location` (index where the item was found).
  - If `found == false`, return `-1` (indicating the item is not in the array).

### **How It Works:**
#### **Example Input & Execution:**
```java
int[] numbers = {5, 12, 8, 20, 7};
int index = seqSearch(numbers, 20);
System.out.println(index);
```
1. It searches for `20` in `{5, 12, 8, 20, 7}`.
2. The loop runs until it finds `20` at **index 3**.
3. The function returns `3`, so the output is:
   ```
   3
   ```

### **Key Features:**
âœ… **Linear Search:** Works by checking each element one by one.  
âœ… **Worst-case Complexity:** **O(N)** (if the item is at the last index or missing).  
âœ… **Best-case Complexity:** **O(1)** (if the item is at index `0`).

### **Conclusion:**
ðŸ”¹ This is a **simple and effective** way to search in small, unsorted arrays.  
ðŸ”¹ It stops searching once the item is found, making it slightly optimized.  
ðŸ”¹ However, for larger datasets, **binary search or hash-based methods** would be better.
