Parameters:

arrayOne: The source array (contains the original data).
arrayTwo: The destination array (receives the copied values).
For Loop:

The loop runs from i = 0 to i < arrayOne.length, ensuring that every element of arrayOne is accessed.
It assigns each element of arrayOne[i] to arrayTwo[i], effectively copying the contents.

Important Reminder:
The comment in the code warns:
// arrayOne's size must equal to arrayTwo
// else it will result to ArrayOutOfBound.

Why? If arrayTwo is smaller than arrayOne, trying to access arrayTwo[i] beyond its size will cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
Fix: Ensure arrayTwo is at least the same size as arrayOne.
