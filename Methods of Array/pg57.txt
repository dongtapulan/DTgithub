Sure! Let's break down the code step-by-step:

### Code Snippet

```java
public static double largest(double ... list) {
    double max = 0.0;
    int arraySize = list.length;

    if (arraySize != 0) {
        for (int i = 0; i < arraySize; i++) {
            if (max < list[i]) {
                max = list[i];
            }
        }
    }
    return max;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Method Declaration**:
   - The method is named `largest` and is declared as `public static`. This means it can be called without creating an instance of the class it belongs to.
   - It returns a `double` value, which will be the largest value in the provided list.
   - The method takes a variable-length argument list (`double ... list`), allowing you to pass multiple `double` values.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `double max = 0.0;`: Initializes a variable `max` to store the largest value found in the list. It starts at `0.0`.

3. **Array Size Determination**:
   - `int arraySize = list.length;`: Determines the length of the provided list and stores it in the `arraySize` variable.

4. **Non-Empty List Check**:
   - `if (arraySize != 0)`: Checks if the list is not empty. If the list is empty, the method will skip the for loop and return `0.0`.

5. **For Loop**:
   - `for (int i = 0; i < arraySize; i++)`: Iterates through each element in the list using a for loop.

6. **Finding the Largest Value**:
   - `if (max < list[i])`: Compares the current element `list[i]` with `max`. If the current element is greater than `max`, `max` is updated to the current element.

7. **Return Statement**:
   - `return max;`: After the loop completes, the method returns the value of `max`, which is the largest value found in the list.

### Summary
This method efficiently scans through the provided list of double values, compares each value to find the largest one, and returns that largest value. If the list is empty, it simply returns `0.0`.
