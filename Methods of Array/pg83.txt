Explanation
Outer Loop: Iterating Through Rows

java
for (int row = 0; row < matrix.length; row++) {
This loop iterates over each row of the matrix.

matrix.length gives the number of rows in the matrix.

Initialize Largest Element for Current Row

java
largest = matrix[row][0];
The variable largest is initialized to the first element of the current row (matrix[row][0]).

This serves as a starting point for finding the largest element in the row.

Inner Loop: Iterating Through Columns

java
for (int col = 1; col < matrix[row].length; col++) {
This loop iterates over each column of the current row, starting from the second element (col = 1).

matrix[row].length gives the number of columns in the current row.

Finding the Largest Element

java
if (largest < matrix[row][col])
    largest = matrix[row][col];
The if statement compares the current element (matrix[row][col]) with the largest value.

If the current element is greater than largest, largest is updated to the current element.

Print the Largest Element of the Current Row

java
System.out.println("The largest element of row " + (row + 1) + " = " + largest);
After finding the largest element in the current row, the code prints the result to the console.

(row + 1) is used to display the row number in a human-readable format (starting from 1).

Summary
The outer loop iterates through each row of the matrix.

The inner loop iterates through each column within the current row to find the largest element.

The largest variable is updated whenever a larger element is found.

The result is printed for each row, showing the largest element.
