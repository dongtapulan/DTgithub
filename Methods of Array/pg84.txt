Explanation
Method Declaration:

java
static void printMatrix(int[][] matrix) {
static: This keyword indicates that the method belongs to the class, not an instance of the class. You can call this method without creating an object of the class.

void: The method does not return any value.

printMatrix: The name of the method.

int[][] matrix: The parameter passed to the method, which is a two-dimensional array of integers.

Outer Loop: Iterating Through Rows:

java
for (int row = 0; row < matrix.length; row++) {
This loop iterates over each row of the matrix.

matrix.length gives the number of rows in the matrix.

Inner Loop: Iterating Through Columns:

java
for (int col = 0; col < matrix[row].length; col++) {
This loop iterates over each column of the current row.

matrix[row].length gives the number of columns in the current row.

Printing Each Element:

java
System.out.printf("%7d", matrix[row][col]);
System.out.printf: This function prints formatted output. 
It allows you to format the output in a specific way.

"%7d": This format specifier means print an integer (d) 
in a field that is at least 7 characters wide. If the integer has fewer than 7 characters, 
it will be padded with spaces on the left.

matrix[row][col]: This represents the current element of the matrix being printed.

Printing a Newline After Each Row:

java
System.err.println();
This prints a newline character after printing all elements of the current row, 
so the next row's elements are printed on a new line.

System.err: This is typically used for printing error messages, 
but here it is used to print a newline. It works similarly to System.out.
